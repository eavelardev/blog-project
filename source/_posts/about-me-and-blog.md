My name is Eduardo Avelar Pantoja, I'm from Mexico and currently studying a Master Degree in Computer Science in the Tijuana Institute of Technology.

I studied college in the University of Colima the Computational Systems Engineering.

My passion for electronics began around 9 years of age. I remember that I questioned how the electronic devices worked, so I disarmed them to know their insides.

I think that the level of education should not depend on where we live, personally I would have liked to be born in a place where I received a good education from an early age, I like learning, I love learning, I consider myself a curious person.

In order for a teacher to be able to teach, he has to acquire the knowledge necessary for it, and the quality of learning varies from place to study. My proposal is to develop intelligent machines and systems for this purpose. The use of Artificial Intelligence is a key part of these systems.

My research will begin with learning technologies and techniques for teaching English to Spanish speakers, using intelligent human-machine interaction techniques.

This project arises because I would like to have someone to teach me the English language, and I think that practice is a key to it as well as the association of English with objects and activities of one's daily life.

In this blog I will share the progress that I have, I will soon show the hardware and software technologies that I will use for this project.
